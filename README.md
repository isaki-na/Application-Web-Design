## About me

Hello! My name is Saraí Moreno, I'm a student on *Universidad Tecmilenio*, currently I'm on the 6th semester of my degree on Software Development.

## About the subject
I'm taking this class called **Application Web Design** which it's goal is giving me an understanding on the design and development of web applications. This class is given by my professor Aaron Narváez.

For this text I'm using ***Markdown*** which is a GitHub feature that let's me edit and giving format in a .md file on GitHub, very useful a when making more sorted and prettier README files.
